basic starting file structure for Umass Dartmouth
This project for me was pretty hard at times. This was because I would work up until a point where I actually had no idea of where to go or what to do next. Some of the major challenges that I had were when I would use code from the code alongs or from the internet and I would have to look through it closely and decide what was what, and what goes where. A more specific challenge that I had was with the gallery because I couldn't get the images to become verticle in the mobile grid. I solved this issue by taking the mobile grid media for the image gallery and bringing it up just under the desktop grid for the image gallery. Another challenge that I faced was that the slide show animations that I was using weren't working. I solved this by making the first image file be blocked when the page was loaded. Overall this project was with out a doubt the hardest and yet rewarding this I have done since starting school at Umass Dartmouth.
